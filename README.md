##Projects:
+**B Mode Imaging Time Reduction**  
I reduced imaging time for B mode medical ultrasound system by **30%** and improved frame rate by **42%** with the same image quality, using optimized B mode imaging procedure transplanted from CPU platform to CPU/GPU combined platform.  
**Technique**: `C/C++`, `CUDA FFTW libs`, `Windows 7 64bits`, `Visual Studio 2010`  
 
+**B Mode Image Speckle Reduction**  
I reduced ultrasound B mode image speckle and increased image SNR by **21.0%**, using local histogram matching algorithm.  
**Technique**: `C/C++`, `Windows 7 64bits`, `Visual Studio 2010`  
 
+**Blood Doppler Signal Accuracy Increase**  
I increased accuracy of arterial blood Doppler signal by **24.2%** and **31.1%** with PG-Capon/PG-APES algorithms, compared to FFT.   
**Technique**: `C/C++`, `Auto Regressive model`, `Capon/APES`, `Mean Shift Algorithms`, `WinCE 5.0`  
 
+**Image Registration Accuracy Increase**  
I improved image registration accuracy of WFOV by **24%** with **10%** time cost increase, using self-modified mean-shift algorithm, compared to MSAD.  
**Technique**: `C/C++`, `Mean Shift Algorithms`, `Windows 7 64bits`, `Visual Studio 2010`  
 
+**Simulated Ultrasound D Mode Imaging Process**  
I simulated ultrasound D mode imaging process(since beam forming).  
**Technique**: `Matlab`.  
 
+**Collected Stockholders' Requirements**  
I collected stockholders' requirements to compose User Specification for project **Management Platform for Technical Employees of Air China Limited**.
